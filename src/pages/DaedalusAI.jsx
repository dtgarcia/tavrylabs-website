        Daedalus AI isn’t just an assistant — it’s a co-engineer. Named after the mythic inventor, this system is powered by GPT-4o and built to unify all Tavry Labs hardware through a consistent, evolving AI interface.

      <p className="text-lg text-zinc-300 mb-4">
        More than anything, Daedalus reflects a new way to collaborate with intelligence. Dallas never used AI to shortcut his learning — he used it to deepen it. This assistant was trained on real projects, through real conversations, designed to help <span className="text-white font-semibold">ideate, debug, and architect solutions</span> alongside its creator.

      <p className="text-lg text-zinc-300 mb-4">
        Eventually, Daedalus will monitor ARC systems, control EXO interfaces, and serve as the voice and brain behind the field systems of tomorrow.
